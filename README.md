## Installation 

The Project is divided into two folders: `client` (frontend) and `backend`.

The frontend uses React with Vite setup, and the backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js version 20.11.1 installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone this project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokuljs/stealth.git
   ```

2. **Once you have cloned the repo, since you're running it in a development environment, you have to run the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.**

   ### Starting the frontend server
   
   ```bash
     cd Client
   ```

   ```bash
      npm install
   ```

   ```bash
      npm run dev
   ```

Each command is now separated into its own block for clarity.
   ### Starting the backend server
   
   

   ```bash
      cd backend
   ```

   ```bash
      npm install
   ```

   ```bash
      npm run dev
   ```

Each command is now separated into its own block for clarity.

3. **Your frontend is running on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/). Create an account, sign in, and use it.**
