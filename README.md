## Installation 

The Project is divided into two folders: `client` (frontend) and `backend`.

The frontend uses React with Vite setup, and the backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js version 20.11.1 installed on your system.

### Steps

1. Clone this project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokuljs/stealth.git

Since we are running this in a development environment, you need to run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

2. Setting up the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
3.# Open another terminal
# For setting up the backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
